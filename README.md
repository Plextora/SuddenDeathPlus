# FAQ:

## How do I download this?

The .exe file can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/Plextora/SuddenDeathPlus/releases/latest)

## My antivirus flagged this as a virus!! You're trying to take over my PC!!!!
I wouldn't be surprised if this program was flagged by any antiviruses, as this is basically malware (crashes your computer). However, this isn't some data stealer, and you can look through the source code to see for yourself. Get ChatGPT to explain it for you if you don't know how to read code.
